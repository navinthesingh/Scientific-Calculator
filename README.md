# Scientific-Calculator
Scientific calculator app that was developed using the scalaFX graphical user interface. The scientific calculator can perform the basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. It is also able to perform the advanced functions such as factorial, sine, cosine, tangent, logarithm of base 10 and square root. The calculator also consists of two constants which are the PI constant and the Eulerâ€™s number constant. The other part of this app is the Volume and surface area page. This page allows the user to calculate the volume and surface area of a cube, cuboid, cylinder, cone, pyramid and a sphere.
